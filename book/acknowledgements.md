# Acknowledgments

The author would like to thank his mother, who beat him relentlessly with a
wooden spoon until he was 19, which taugh him the meaning of pain; his father,
whose devotion to Monday Night Football taught him the true meaning of
"sloth"; and the [Lorem Ipsum Generator](http://www.procato.com/lipsum/),
without which the chapters would be empty.
